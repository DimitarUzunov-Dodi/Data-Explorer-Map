Next week plans:

Questions:
    - Is the current Read.me adequate.
    - Is the appendix needed in the project report, as the technical    writing team have asked us
    about it if it should be there.
    - Total ordering of chapters in the report. - is everything in  place and is there something
    that should be removed or added.
    - Do we have to add the functionality of our project to the project     plan?
    - Potential last minute questions.

Meeting notes:
    - READ.me - main purpose is mainly for  developers, so it should be fine as it is now.
    - Test coverage - Tell what testing we have. Explain how we have used test coverage throughout the project. What is high coverage for us.
    - Add testing  section if our process was big enough. If not maybe just a subsection.
    - MoSCoW req. - better to put them where technical writing wants them, which is probably in the body and not the appendix.
    - Maybe write what requirements have we completed, what is worked on and what is left.
    - The report is "not super big and finished"
    - Problem statement - Be a statement, currently only first is statement after that big text that is not appropriate  
    - APA references -fix them
    - "we did research" - what research, what have we done, show process and results. 
    - ethics part - not use while driving -this should be common sense, how have we actually approached it.
    -Finish Buddy Check, report, presentation.
