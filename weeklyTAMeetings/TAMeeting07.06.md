    Important notes:
    Images for the final report - include only if important for the point you are trying to make. No need of unnecessary distractions.

    Pipeline - include things that are relevant to the project, for example testing coverage. It is quite project dependent so no clear answer could have been given.

    Group is independent -  Generally a good thing. It meant that most of the things we do by ourselves  and do not bother the company. We can maybe ask more questions but for now everything we have done has been with their support as we have asked them several times if our way is ok with them.
